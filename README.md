# Blockchain-Powered AI Marketplace

A revolutionary decentralized platform enabling seamless interaction with AI models. Users can upload, buy, and evaluate AI models securely and transparently using Ethereum blockchain technology.

## **How to Get Started**

1. **Blockchain Setup**:
   Launch a local Ethereum blockchain environment using Ganache or connect to a test network like Ropsten.

2. **Deploy Contracts**:
   Compile and deploy smart contracts with the following commands:
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   truffle migrate
   ```

3. **Configure Application**:
   Update the frontend with contract details:
   - Place the ABI file in the frontend directory under `src/contracts/`.
   - Create an `.env` file and add the deployed contract address:
     ```
     REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<Deployed_Contract_Address>
     ```

4. **Run the Frontend**:
   Install dependencies and start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## **Key Capabilities**
- **AI Model Listing**: Creators can publish their AI models with detailed metadata and pricing.
- **Secure Transactions**: Buyers can purchase models via blockchain-enabled payments.
- **Model Ratings**: Users can leave reviews and ratings for purchased models.
- **Earnings Management**: Sellers can withdraw accumulated revenue securely.

## **User Workflow**
1. **Creators**: Publish AI models by specifying a name, description, and price in Ether.
2. **Buyers**: Browse models, make purchases, and rate the quality of models.
3. **Transparency**: All interactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Integration with decentralized storage solutions for hosting AI models.
- Enhanced UI for filtering and searching models.
- Support for multi-signature wallets for additional security.
